Bot download link : https://stockfishchess.org/download/ (Stockfish 14)

Save the folder on your C folders (like what i did on my code)
- self.stockfish_engine = stockfish.Stockfish(path=r'D:\Programming\Projects\PYTHON\Chess PyQt5 Project\stockfish_14.1_win_x64_avx2\stockfish_14.1_win_x64_avx2.exe')
- line 13, playStockfish.py 

*NOTE : The program is still executable without chess-engine requirement as i mentioned above (You can only play with living person).
        Just make sure you have required modules installed to launch the program.
